# Capstone Project - 911 Response in Toronto

This project will analyze information based on what is sent to the Ontario Fire Marshal relating to all incidents to which Toronto Fire responds. The type and frequency of all incidents will be categorized by the regions in and around the city of Toronto. The conclusion may help determining the number of hiring more call operators or providing ideas which regions the communication centre or the 911 control head quarter possibly reduce the wait time on 911 calls.

I retrieved all data set from Open Data Catalogue from the City of Toronto. The two data set were described as followed:
1. Fire Station Locations - City of Toronto fire station location (XY coordinates)
2. 2011-2017 Basic Incidents Details - All 911 call response from 2011 to 2017
